# User-Based Voice Identification using TinyML video on project https://youtu.be/TjEqqUWRu0g
This project implements a real-time voice-based speaker identification system using
Edge Impulse and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

## Features
- Identifies 4 registered users based on voice
- Rejects background noise and silence
- Runs fully offline on a microcontroller
- Low latency and low power using TinyML

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Software & Tools
- Edge Impulse Studio
- Arduino IDE
- TinyML

## Methodology
1. Audio data collection (voice + noise)
2. MFCC feature extraction
3. Neural network training
4. Deployment on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Applications
- Voice-based access control
- Smart IoT systems
- User authentication
